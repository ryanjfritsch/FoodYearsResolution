Pinch two opposing corners of the dough together over the cheese.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Do the same with the other two corners to create a bundle. Pinch the folded sides together to secure the cheese. Repeat with the remaining dough and cheese.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Heat 6 cups water in a medium saucepan and over high heat.

They were really easy to make and using spicy mustard took them to the next level. Next time I should wrap the dough tighter so that the cheese stays inside in the oven. I think a lot of the cheese was lost during baking.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/cheesy-pretzel-dumplings-4538840","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/87bc4fead0d1a4ff2a83d4d83b88149e/f8d99/pretzelDumplingsHeader.jpg"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/87bc4fead0d1a4ff2a83d4d83b88149e/ca4e2/pretzelDumplingsHeader.jpg","srcSet":"/static/87bc4fead0d1a4ff2a83d4d83b88149e/fbb42/pretzelDumplingsHeader.jpg 175w,\n/static/87bc4fead0d1a4ff2a83d4d83b88149e/d4326/pretzelDumplingsHeader.jpg 350w,\n/static/87bc4fead0d1a4ff2a83d4d83b88149e/ca4e2/pretzelDumplingsHeader.jpg 700w,\n/static/87bc4fead0d1a4ff2a83d4d83b88149e/3d806/pretzelDumplingsHeader.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pretzel-dumplings/"}}
