Not a complete flop, just nothing special. They are pretty easy to make, and serve as good left-overs as well. Baking the peppers in the oven for 75 minutes causes them to become flimsy, and the peppers may bend or tip over from the weight of the stuffing (as seen in the photo to the right). Make sure they are as balanced as possible before being placed in the oven.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/lightened-up-stuffed-peppers-recipe-2119293","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/another-meal/"}}
