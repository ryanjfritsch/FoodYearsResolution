I've done a good job with that so far, but I'm sure it will make its way back into a recipe I make every once in a while. This meal was pretty simple to make, and turned out to be a lot heavier than expected, most likely because of all the cheese. If I make this again, I will use the recommended amount of cheese rather than adding more 'for taste'. That being said, when you get a bite of equal amounts of chicken mix and straight avocado, it really is a fantastic taste.","sourceLink":"https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/245863/chicken-stuffed-baked-avocados/?internalSource=popular&referringContentType=Homepage","sourceWebsite":"All Recipes","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/chocolate-peanut-butter-pretzel-bars/"}}
