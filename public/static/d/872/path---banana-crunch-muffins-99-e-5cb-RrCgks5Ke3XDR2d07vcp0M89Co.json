These Hawaiian burgers were awesome, but there were a few small changes I would make next time. I made the patties a little bit too thick and round, which made stacking the cheese, bacon and pineapple on top somewhat difficult. I also probably would have added more of the teriyaki/mayo combination sauce as I wasn't able to taste it very much. That being said, I can definitely see myself making these burgers again later in the summer.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/hawaiian-burger-5244255","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/banana-crunch-muffins/"}}
