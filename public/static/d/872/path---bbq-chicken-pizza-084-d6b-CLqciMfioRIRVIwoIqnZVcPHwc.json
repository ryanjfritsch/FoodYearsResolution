The ribs will be cooked using indirect heat.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">(Optional) Fill a metal pan 3/4 with water and place on the grill above the lit burner or lit coals. While grilling, the water will steam, providing consistent temperatures and increased air moisture.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Remove ribs from their packaging, and pat down with a paper towel to dry.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Using a knife and paper towel, remove the fat membrane from the bone side of the ribs. Trim other loose parts of meat or fat from the rack.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Pour honey mustard on the bone side of the rack, and spread around with your hands making sure the entire side is evenly coated. Don't use too much mustard - just enough to make sure the seasoning will stick.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Apply the rub of your choice to the honey mustard-covered side of the ribs. Again you don't want to use too much - just enough to evenly coat the side. Lightly press the seasoning onto the ribs.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Let sit for 5-10 minutes. When the rub seasoning starts to look wet, you can flip the ribs and repeat the honey mustard and rub seasoning process for the other side.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Place the rack bone-side down on the grill, as far away as possible from the lit burner/coals. We will be performing a \"low and slow\" cook of the ribs - low heat and cooking slowly for a long period of time.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Let cook for an hour and a half.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Rotate your rack(s). If cooking more than one, switch racks that are closest to the burner with racks further away, and vice-versa.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Let cook for an hour.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Rotate ribs again. Flip rack(s) so the bone-side is up. Be sure to check the water levels in your water pan if you used one.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Let cook for an hour.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Flip rack(s) back to bone-side down.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Let cook for 45 minutes.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Apply BBQ sauce to both sides of the rack(s). Turn all burners up to high, or move ribs to charcoal side of grill. Flip rack(s) every 2-3 minutes until outside is crispy.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Pull ribs off grill, and let sit for 10 minutes. Cut ribs, and serve.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"BBQ Chicken Pizza","description":"This post is related to the gatsbyjs","rating":4,"recipeIntroParagraph":"This is the best meal I've made this year so far, and it isn't close! These ribs turned out so much better than I thought they would. I didn't follow a direct recipe, but rather followed instructions on how to cook ribs from a YouTube video, and then used my own honey mustard and rib rub. In the video (linked below), jalapeño honey mustard was used before the rub. If I make these ribs again, I would want to try that out. I used normal honey mustard which provided fantastic sweet flavor, but I am curious if the jalapeño would add a substantial kick. I put these ribs on the grill for about 4-4.5 hours, but the meat was only 'fall off the bone' tender on a few of the ribs. I think if I left it on the grill longer, I could have gotten even better results. In the linked video below, the ribs were in a smoker for about 7 hours. I used a gas grill, so the results could also be dependent on the type of grill used. I don't have a smoker, but would like to try one eventually.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/almost-famous-barbecue-chicken-pizza-recipe-2107567","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/28791468056002f8e51e87eb515cdca3/865b2/bbqChickenPizzaHeader.png"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/28791468056002f8e51e87eb515cdca3/97318/bbqChickenPizzaHeader.png","srcSet":"/static/28791468056002f8e51e87eb515cdca3/1f258/bbqChickenPizzaHeader.png 175w,\n/static/28791468056002f8e51e87eb515cdca3/4cb21/bbqChickenPizzaHeader.png 350w,\n/static/28791468056002f8e51e87eb515cdca3/97318/bbqChickenPizzaHeader.png 700w,\n/static/28791468056002f8e51e87eb515cdca3/fefee/bbqChickenPizzaHeader.png 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bbq-chicken-pizza/"}}
