After looking through the ingredients and actually cooking the pie, I realized this wasn't a pizza at all. I'm doing my online research as I'm writing this, and I'm finding that this is a traditional Italian Easter dish which would make a lot of sense. It has a lot of cheese, flavorful Italian sausage, a fantastic crust, and no pizza sauce or anything like that. It was incredible as a dinner and I'm sure it would be awesome at Easter brunch as well.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/spinach-ravioli-with-tomato-sauce-recipe-1972995","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/spinach-ravioli/"}}
