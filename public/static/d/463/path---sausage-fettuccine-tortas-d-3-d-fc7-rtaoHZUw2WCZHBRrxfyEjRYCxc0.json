I always hesitate when I see mayonnaise combined with fruit in a recipe, but it always turns out fine. We opted to use walnuts and dried apricots (which were optional in the recipe), and I think both gave the pitas more taste. We also turned the broiler on and placed the pitas in the oven for 5 minutes right before serving. This gave them a little more crunch and enhanced the meal in my opinion. Maybe not the healthiest meal by design, but a 'light' one that will be great during summer.","sourceLink":"https://photos.app.goo.gl/2LWPUEuGDd81iEto9","sourceWebsite":"The Food Network","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/sausage-fettuccine-tortas/"}}
