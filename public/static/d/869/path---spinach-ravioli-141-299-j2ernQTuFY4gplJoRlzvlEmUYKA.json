Though I thought that was pricey, it was worth it. The taste of the cheese inside the ravioli was awesome with the tomato sauce recipe. This isn't a complex meal at all; it only took about 45 mintues. It's also great for leftovers.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/spinach-ravioli-with-tomato-sauce-recipe-1972995","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/spinach-ravioli/"}}
