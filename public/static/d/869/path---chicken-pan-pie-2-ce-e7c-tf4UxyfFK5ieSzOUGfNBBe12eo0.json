It was very simple to make; the most challenging part was getting the tortilla chip crumbs to stick to the crescent rolls. With a little bit of force, and placing the bits that fell off back on the dough, it was easy enough. The chicken filling tasted great, and was held in place nicely by the crescent rolls. The ring comes out of the oven already cut into easy to grab pieces, and thus would be a great apetizer for a small party. I added guac to the salsa and sour cream dipping options, and that tasted fantastic with everything as well.","sourceLink":"https://www.pamperedchef.com/recipe/Main+Dishes/Chicken+Enchilada+Ring/19993","sourceWebsite":"Pampered Chef","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/chicken-pan-pie/"}}
