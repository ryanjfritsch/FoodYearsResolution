Pinch one end closed.

The ones I had always came frozen from Costco, so I was excited to try to make my own by hand. This recipe turned out to be more difficult than expected because of the construction of each dumpling. You have to be very gentle when forming the dumpling so that the filling doesn't get squeezed out. Additionally, only a very small part of the wet dumpling wrapper should be pressed together to seal the contents inside. If too much of the wrapper is pressed together, there won't be any room left inside the dumpling and the filling will be squeezed out. One difference between the recipe and my creation was ground pork vs. pork tenderloin. I used a tenderloin, which doesn't have as much fat or moisture. It is possible that the dumplings would have had more flavor if I had used ground pork instead. Regardless, I did like how these turned out; they had a lot of flavor and the dipping sauce was good as well. The recipe made about 30-35 dumplings which left plenty of left-overs.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/pork-dumplings-2042427","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/2c99afaa142191a3c9086e14cca20551/865b2/porkDumplingsHeader.png"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/2c99afaa142191a3c9086e14cca20551/97318/porkDumplingsHeader.png","srcSet":"/static/2c99afaa142191a3c9086e14cca20551/1f258/porkDumplingsHeader.png 175w,\n/static/2c99afaa142191a3c9086e14cca20551/4cb21/porkDumplingsHeader.png 350w,\n/static/2c99afaa142191a3c9086e14cca20551/97318/porkDumplingsHeader.png 700w,\n/static/2c99afaa142191a3c9086e14cca20551/fefee/porkDumplingsHeader.png 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pork-dumplings/"}}
