Microwave on High about 45 seconds just until slices have softened a bit. Cover plate with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Roll puff pastry sheet to less than 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, cut two 3-inch by 12-inch rectangles. Reserve remaining pieces for another use.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Spread melted butter over dough; top with a generous amount of cinnamon-sugar. Place apple slices along 1 long edge of dough, about 1/4 inch beyond edge of dough, overlapping slices slightly.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Fold bottom half of dough over the apple slices to form a long \"folder\" of dough with rounded edges of apple slices exposed.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Beat egg and water together in a bowl. Paint surface of dough with egg wash. Sprinkle with more cinnamon-sugar, to taste.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Starting from one end, roll dough not too tightly to form a rose-shaped pastry. Seal roll with end of dough strip.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Transfer roses to prepared ramekins. Sprinkle with a little more cinnamon-sugar. Place ramekins directly on middle rack of preheated oven.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Bake until well browned, about 45 minutes. Remove ramekins with tongs and place on baking sheet to cool 5 to 10 minutes. Remove apple roses from ramekins and finish cooling on rack.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Baked Apple Roses","description":"This post is related to the gatsbyjs","rating":3,"recipeIntroParagraph":"I just wanted to try these roses because they looked really cool and have that 'wow' factor. They turned out visually just as expected! Unfortunately, the taste wasn't as good as I was hoping for. I was imagining they would have more apple flavor but these didn't. I think I could have used a different type of apple to provide the flavor I was looking for. I used fuji apples, and I will have to search online for the best apples for baking if I try this again. Overall not bad, but just a slight disappointment.","sourceLink":"https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/244198/baked-apple-roses/","sourceWebsite":"All Recipes","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/efd5edb15cc7e70c6ee9149f0c5fb941/f8d99/bakedAppleRosesHeader.jpg"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/efd5edb15cc7e70c6ee9149f0c5fb941/ca4e2/bakedAppleRosesHeader.jpg","srcSet":"/static/efd5edb15cc7e70c6ee9149f0c5fb941/fbb42/bakedAppleRosesHeader.jpg 175w,\n/static/efd5edb15cc7e70c6ee9149f0c5fb941/d4326/bakedAppleRosesHeader.jpg 350w,\n/static/efd5edb15cc7e70c6ee9149f0c5fb941/ca4e2/bakedAppleRosesHeader.jpg 700w,\n/static/efd5edb15cc7e70c6ee9149f0c5fb941/3d806/bakedAppleRosesHeader.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/baked-apple-roses/"}}
