It was truly a trip to flavortown. The spice levels were perfect; you could taste them a little bit but were not strong. The italian sausage was a great addition as well. It gave the jalapeños extra weight and some bonus flavor. I would recommend these as a party appetizer.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/italian-stuffed-jalapenos-recipe-1951967","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/3212855df76bc0647cd04e6516acb635/f8d99/italianStuffedJalapenosHeader.jpg"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/3212855df76bc0647cd04e6516acb635/ca4e2/italianStuffedJalapenosHeader.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3212855df76bc0647cd04e6516acb635/fbb42/italianStuffedJalapenosHeader.jpg 175w,\n/static/3212855df76bc0647cd04e6516acb635/d4326/italianStuffedJalapenosHeader.jpg 350w,\n/static/3212855df76bc0647cd04e6516acb635/ca4e2/italianStuffedJalapenosHeader.jpg 700w,\n/static/3212855df76bc0647cd04e6516acb635/3d806/italianStuffedJalapenosHeader.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/italian-stuffed-jalapenos/"}}
