Some of the slices were a little too dried out, though the taste was awesome. Squeezing some lime juice into the taco once it is built is a game changer, and even provided some moisture to the drier pieces of pork. The chipotle pepper powder provided a little kick, so if you aren't into spicy food I would use 1/2 or 3/4 teaspoon of the powder on the meat instead of the instructed 1 teaspoon. The link below also includes a brown sugar pineapple side-dish recipe, which I opted to ignore this time around.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/grilled-chipotle-pork-tacos-with-red-slaw-and-brown-sugar-pineapple-recipe-3361887","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":{"childImageSharp":null}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/walnut-shrimp/"}}
