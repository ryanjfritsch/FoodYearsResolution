It's a homerun every time and I will definitely keep it in mind whenever I need to make a pie for any event. It's really easy to make, especially if you just buy a frozen pie crust and don't make one on your own. It also goes great with ice cream, whipped cream, or a glass of milk.","sourceLink":"https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/chocolate-chunk-pecan-pie-recipe","sourceWebsite":"King Arthur Flour","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/spinach-feta-rugelach/"}}
