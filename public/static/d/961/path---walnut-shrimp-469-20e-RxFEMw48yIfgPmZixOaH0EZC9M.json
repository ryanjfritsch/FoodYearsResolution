Some of the slices were a little too dried out, though the taste was awesome. Squeezing some lime juice into the taco once it is built is a game changer, and even provided some moisture to the drier pieces of pork. The chipotle pepper powder provided a little kick, so if you aren't into spicy food I would use 1/2 or 3/4 teaspoon of the powder on the meat instead of the instructed 1 teaspoon. The link below also includes a brown sugar pineapple side-dish recipe, which I opted to ignore this time around.","sourceLink":"https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/93234/honey-walnut-shrimp/?internalSource=staff%20pick&referringId=430&referringContentType=Recipe%20Hub","sourceWebsite":"All Recipes","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/walnut-shrimp/"}}
