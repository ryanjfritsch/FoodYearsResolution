I have modified the instructions from Food Network to make them easier to understand. This recipe would have been fantastic, but I misread the amount of house seasoning to use in the beer batter for the fish. The original recipe calls for 2 & 1/2 cups of House Seasoning, and only 1/2 teaspoon is used in the batter (????). I didn't see that the ingredients list says '1/2 teaspoon House Seasoning', and instead followed the instructions that said 'stir in House Seasoning'... you can probably guess how the fish turned out. Extremely salty. So salty in fact, I decided they were not edible, and I just threw them out. Should I have stopped and realized the amount of salt, pepper and garlic powder I was adding was way too much? Yes. But I didn't, and I was left with a nasty product. Next time I won't make that mistake. The chips, on the other hand, were fantastic. Although the process to make them was somewhat lengthy and messy, they were worth it. I would like to try this meal again in the future and see how it turns out with properly made fish.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/beer-battered-fish-and-chips-recipe-2040495","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/337b4eafdf5c81ca0eb272a179e164cf/865b2/bbqRibsHeader.png"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/337b4eafdf5c81ca0eb272a179e164cf/97318/bbqRibsHeader.png","srcSet":"/static/337b4eafdf5c81ca0eb272a179e164cf/1f258/bbqRibsHeader.png 175w,\n/static/337b4eafdf5c81ca0eb272a179e164cf/4cb21/bbqRibsHeader.png 350w,\n/static/337b4eafdf5c81ca0eb272a179e164cf/97318/bbqRibsHeader.png 700w,\n/static/337b4eafdf5c81ca0eb272a179e164cf/fefee/bbqRibsHeader.png 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bbq-ribs/"}}
