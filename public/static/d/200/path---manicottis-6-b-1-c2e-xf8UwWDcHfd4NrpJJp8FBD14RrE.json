It was a pretty simple combination of breakfast favorites: pancakes, bacon and scrambled eggs. I used the pancakes as taco shells, put the eggs and bacon in the middle, and then put some syrup on top. A bite of all three foods with the syrup tasted amazing. Though optional, I used a metal taco rack to prop the tacos up and let the pancakes form into their shell shape. The most interesting part of this recipe is really the presentation; the ingredients aren't complicated at all but the final result is pretty unique.","sourceLink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByxiwoHjG7N/?igshid=i6242t4rmkee","sourceWebsite":"Instagram - @CheatDayEats (second video in post)","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/manicottis/"}}
