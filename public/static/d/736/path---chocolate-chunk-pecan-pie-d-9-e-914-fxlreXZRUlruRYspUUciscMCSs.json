I'm not sure what happened, but the puff pastry did not hold. After stacking the chicken and cheese, wrapping everything in the puff pastry, and then flipping it, it seemed like it would hold. However after 20 minutes in the oven the top had ripped open and the ingredients were falling everywhere. Even though visually the recipe didn't turn out great, it tasted awesome and I would recommend it.","sourceLink":"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/buffalo-chicken-wellington-5270853","sourceWebsite":"Food Network","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/chocolate-chunk-pecan-pie/"}}
