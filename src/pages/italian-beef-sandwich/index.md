recipeIntroParagraph: 'This recipe is a great one to get started with a slow cooker. All you have to do is place the meat in the slow cooker, add the water and seasoning/dressing mix, and let it cook for 6 to 7 hours. Easy as that. The result was tender and great tasting pork that went great with peppercinis on hamburger buns. Definitely a simple but effective meal.'
