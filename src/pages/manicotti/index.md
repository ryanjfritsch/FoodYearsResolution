recipeIntroParagraph: "I had never heard of Manicotti before, but the photo on the recipe page looked good and I liked the ingredients so I tried it out. I'm glad I did, this was an excellent Italian dish. Though very heavy because of the tomato cream sauce and cheese spinach filling, the great taste made was worth it. Making a dessert recipe is always a hit, but it's great to find a solid dinner dish that isn't too difficult to make and provides great flavor. This recipe is exactly that."

<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Spray a 9 x 11 inch oval or rectangle baking dish with vegetable oil cooking spray.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bring a large pot of boiling salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the oil and pasta.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cook until just tender, but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and cover with plastic wrap to prevent the pasta from drying out.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">In a large nonstick skillet, cook the bacon until crisp and brown, about 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels and set aside to cool.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">In a large bowl, add the cooled bacon, the spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the pepper, nutmeg and egg. Stir until well combined.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Using a small spoon, fill the manicotti tubes with the ricotta mixture.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">For the sauce: Bring the cream, milk, flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg to a simmer in a heavy, medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the mozzarella in batches, constantly whisking, until the sauce is thick and smooth.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Reduce the heat to low and simmer 1 minute, whisking occasionally. Whisk in the tomato basil sauce.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Pour half of the sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Arrange the manicotti in a single layer on the sauce. Pour the remaining sauce on top of the manicotti and top with the mozzarella.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Drizzle with olive oil and cover the dish with foil.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bake until heated through and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
</ol>
