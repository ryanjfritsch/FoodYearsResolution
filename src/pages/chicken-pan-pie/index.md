recipeIntroParagraph: "This is a twist on the popular Chicken Pot Pie. Rather than using a circular deep pot, the recipe calls for a normal sheet pan. The ingredients are very similar as well. This pie turned out pretty good, especially considering the crust was only placed on top of the main ingredients. However, I thought there were too many onions, so next time I will add less. The recipe produced a decent amount of leftovers as well which is always a plus."

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Ingredients</h1>

<h3>Safeway</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped</li>
    <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 rotisserie chicken, skin discarded and meat shredded (about 3 cups)</li>
    <li>One 14-ounce bag frozen pearl onions, thawed</li>
    <li>2 large carrots, sliced into thin half-moons</li>
    <li>2 stalks celery, finely diced</li>
    <li>Two 17.3-ounce packages puff pastry (4 sheets)</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten with a splash of water</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Spray an 18-by-13-inch sheet pan with cooking spray.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Melt the butter with the thyme in small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring, until a sandy consistency, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Pour in the chicken broth, whisking constantly until smooth. Stir in 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of black pepper and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Lower the heat and simmer gently until thickened and the flour flavor is gone, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Meanwhile, add the chicken, onions, carrots and celery to the prepared sheet pan and toss to combine; set aside.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Stack 2 puff pastry sheets on top of each other on a lightly floured surface. Roll the puff pastry out to a 15-by-15-inch square.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Using a spoon, scoop chicken mixture evenly onto widest end of each triangle. Bring points of triangles up over filling and tuck under wide ends of dough at center of ring. (Filling will not be completely covered)</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cut the pastry into 1-inch strips so you have 15 strips total. Repeat with the remaining 2 puff pastry sheets.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Pour the gravy over top of the chicken mixture on the sheet pan. Arrange the pastry strips over the filling lengthwise, overlapping them slightly so most of the filling is covered.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Trim any overhang from the edges of the pan. Brush the pastry with the egg wash and bake until deep golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
</ol>
