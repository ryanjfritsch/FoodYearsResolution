recipeIntroParagraph: 'These sliders were pretty easy to make, and tasted great. The combination of the main ingredients with the cheeses were fantastic. That being said, these were pretty heavy so there were a lot left over. The recipe will make about 12-15 sliders depending on how much you fill the rolls. These would be great as both apetizers or a main course.'

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Ingredients</h1>

<h3>Safeway</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound beef top sirloin steaks</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
    <li>10 mini sandwich rolls</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped bell peppers</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups freshly shredded provolone cheese</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Season steak generously with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Sear steaks for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip; add diced onions to the sides.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cook until steaks begin to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes more.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Push onions under the steaks and cook until browned but still crunchy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove steaks to a plate.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Place rolls on a baking pan lined with foil.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Hollow out the top of each roll by cutting in at a 45-degree angle. Pinch off some of the bread inside to make room for the filling.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Slice steaks into thin strips, then across into 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer to a mixing bowl.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the sauteed onions and accumulated juices. Toss in pickled peppers, cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups provolone, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Taste and season with salt as needed. Spoon filling into the rolls and top with remaining provolone cheese.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and edges of the rolls are starting to brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Optional: turn off the oven and turn the broiler on high for 2-3 minutes to slightly brown the cheese on the tops of the sliders.</li>
</ol>
