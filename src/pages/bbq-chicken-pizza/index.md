recipeIntroParagraph: "I'm a big BBQ fan (2 of the last 3 things I've made have used BBQ sauce), and I think this pizza will be in the top-5 BBQ recipes for this website when it's all said and done. It was very easy to make, and tasted great. I used Stubb's Sweet Heat BBQ sauce which has a little bit of a kick. I didn't mind it, but for people who don't like spice, a sweeter BBQ sauce should be selected. Also, I will take the pizza dough out of the fridge further in advance next time. I didn't let it get all the way to room temperature and it was a bit tough to work into a full stretched-out circle. The result was a thicker/softer crust though, which was fine by me. I definietely recommend this recipe for anyone who wants a straight-forward alternative to normal pizza."

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Ingredients</h1>

<h3>Safeway</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing</li>
    <li>1/2 pound prepared pizza dough, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark barbecue sauce (I used Stubb's Sweet Heat)</li>
    <li>1 8-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
    <li>1 & 1/3 cup grated part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>Fresh cilantro, for topping</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">250Â°F Brush a large bowl with olive oil. Shape the pizza dough into a ball, add it to the bowl and turn to coat with the oil.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Position racks in the upper third and middle of the oven. Place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the top rack and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Meanwhile, lay out a sheet of parchment paper and brush with olive oil. Transfer the ball of dough to the parchment and roll it out into a 10-inch round, stretching it with your hands as needed.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Lightly brush the dough with olive oil, cover with another piece of parchment and set aside to let rise slightly, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">While the dough rises, mix 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce and 1 teaspoon olive oil in a small bowl. Put the chicken in a baking dish, season with salt and pepper and brush with the barbecue sauce mixture.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bake on the middle oven rack until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Let cool, then cut into 1/2-inch cubes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Uncover the dough and spread with the remaining 1/3 cup barbecue sauce, leaving a 3/4-inch border. Top with the chicken, gouda, mozzarella and red onion.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Slide the pizza (on the parchment) onto a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet, then slide onto the hot stone or baking sheet; bake until the cheese melts and the crust is golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro.</li>
