recipeIntroParagraph: "If you're looking for a cheat meal and a slight cooking challenge, this is the one for you. This great-tasting honey walnut shrimp clocks in with these per-serving nutrition stats (this recipe makes 4 servings): 605 calories; 26.3g fat; 68g carbohydrates; 26.1 g protein; 179mg cholesterol; 340mg sodium. Sheesh. Making this meal honestly wasn't too difficult, but frying the shrimp caused some problems. I'm a novice cook of course, and I hadn't fried anything on a stove top before. I placed each shrimp in the oil immediately after coating them with the eggwhite and rice flour batter, which made flipping the shrimp difficult once one side was fried. A better idea would have been to coat all the shrimp with the batter, then place them all in the frying pan at once so that they fried evenly at the same time. Nevertheless, they tasted great and went well with some plain white rice."
