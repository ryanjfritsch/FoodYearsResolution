recipeIntroParagraph: "I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, and the taco pockets turned out just pretty good. Nothing special. The idea is that each pocket contains everything that is in a normal taco, but the way the tortilla is wrapped will keep the tacos from dripping juice. This was true as they really did't drip, but that was about it. Everything else was just a normal taco. They were very easy to make, however, so that is enticing when considering recipes to make again in the future."
