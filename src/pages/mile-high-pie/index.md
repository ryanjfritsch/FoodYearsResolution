recipeIntroParagraph: "This is the first desert dish of R&D Kitchen, and it turned out ok. Only 3/5 stars unfortunately. I am a huge peanut butter fan so I was really looking forward to making this pie. The Nutter Butter crust with the brownie filling was excellent, but was over-powered by the two layers of peanut butter whipped cream and normal whipped cream. I found that the two tastes evened out when I scraped some of the whipped cream topping off. The chocolate chips and peanut butter chips on top were a good addition to the topping and helped bring back some of the flavors of the middle of the pie. However, I don't think it helped enough. Next time I would make/use about half of the instructed peanut butter and whipped cream topping."

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;  margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Equipment</h1>
<ul style="font-size: 20px; margin: 0 0 50px 0;">

</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Grease a 9-inch pie dish with 1 tablespoon butter, then dust with flour. Tap out any excess.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Microwave 4 tablespoons butter in a small microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals until melted, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the peanut butter cookies to the bowl of a food processor and process until fine crumbs have formed. Pour in the melted butter and pulse until the cookies are wet like sand.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Press the cookie crumbs into the bottom and completely up the sides of the prepared pie dish.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Whisk the flour, cocoa powder and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Melt the semisweet chocolate and the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 2 minutes. Stir in the eggs and sugar until well combined.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Gently fold in the flour mixture until well combined. Fold in the peanut butter chips.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Pour the batter in the cookie crust and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Meanwhile, place the cream cheese, peanut butter and marshmallow creme in a medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the heavy cream to a separate medium bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture, then fold in the mini chocolate chips.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Spread the mixture on the top of the pie and chill until completely set, about 2 hours.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">While the pie is chilling, whisk the cream cheese, heavy cream and sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Mound the whipped topping on top of the pie and sprinkle with more mini chocolate chips and peanut butter chocolate chips.</li>
