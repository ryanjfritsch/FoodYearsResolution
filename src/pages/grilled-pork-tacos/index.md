recipeIntroParagraph: "These grilled pork tacos would have been great had I not left the pork on the grill too long. Some of the slices were a little too dried out, though the taste was awesome. Squeezing some lime juice into the taco once it is built is a game changer, and even provided some moisture to the drier pieces of pork. The chipotle pepper powder provided a little kick, so if you aren't into spicy food I would use 1/2 or 3/4 teaspoon of the powder on the meat instead of the instructed 1 teaspoon. The link below also includes a brown sugar pineapple side-dish recipe, which I opted to ignore this time around."

<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat a grill on medium-high heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">For pork seasoning, combine the cilantro, lime juice, oil, chile powder, garlic and onions in a large dish. Add the pork slices and turn to coat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">For the slaw, combine the cabbage, cilantro, oil, vinegar, chile powder, bell peppers, red onions and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a large bowl. Toss to mix and set aside.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Remove the pork from the marinade and discard the remaining marinade. Sprinkle the pork on both sides with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Grill, turning once, until browned and still a little rosy inside, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large plate.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Grill the tortillas, turning once, until grill marks appear and the tortillas are softened, about 1 minute. Transfer two tortillas per plate.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Divide the pork and a little slaw among the tortillas. Serve with lime wedges.</li>
