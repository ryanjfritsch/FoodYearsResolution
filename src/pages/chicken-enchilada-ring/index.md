recipeIntroParagraph: "I originally had this dish at easter brunch this year, and really liked it. It was very simple to make; the most challenging part was getting the tortilla chip crumbs to stick to the crescent rolls. With a little bit of force, and placing the bits that fell off back on the dough, it was easy enough. The chicken filling tasted great, and was held in place nicely by the crescent rolls. The ring comes out of the oven already cut into easy to grab pieces, and thus would be a great apetizer for a small party. I added guac to the salsa and sour cream dipping options, and that tasted fantastic with everything as well."

<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Chop chicken and olives; place in large Bowl. Add cheese, green chilies, mayonnaise and seasoning mix.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Seed and chop 1 tomato. Slice lime in half. Using a juicer, juice one half of lime to measure 1 teaspoon juice. Reserve remaining lime for garnish. Add chopped tomato and lime juice to chicken mixture.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Reserve 2 tablespoons crushed chips; add remaining chips to chicken mixture and mix well.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Sprinkle reserved crushed chips over flat side of a large cutting board. </li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Unroll crescent dough. Place dough, sticky side down, onto crushed chips; press down lightly so chips adhere to dough.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Separate dough into triangles. Arrange triangles, chip side down, in a circle on a large round stone baking dish with wide ends overlapping in the center and points toward outside. (There should be a 5-inch diameter opening in center.)</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Using a spoon, scoop chicken mixture evenly onto widest end of each triangle. Bring points of triangles up over filling and tuck under wide ends of dough at center of ring. (Filling will not be completely covered.)</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bake 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">For garnish, cut remaining tomato into 8 wedges. Cut remaining half of lime into 4 slices; cut in half.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Arrange between openings of ring. Serve with salsa and sour cream.</li>
