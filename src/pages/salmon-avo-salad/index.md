recipeIntroParagraph: "''Step aside, tuna salad! We have a new friend in town: salmon salad. And she is amazing. I use canned salmon for this recipe to keep it convenient for lunches, but you can always substitute cooked fresh salmon.'' (from recipe source). This was the first recipe of the R&D Kitchen cookbook, and it was a very easy way to get started. All you have to do is cut up the ingredients and throw them into a large bowl. Doesn't get much easier than that."
