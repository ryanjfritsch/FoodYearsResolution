recipeIntroParagraph: "I've been doing unhealthy recipes a few weeks in a row (and at the time I was behind in my recipes by one week), so I decided to find a simple and healthy meal to make. This looked like the perfect one. It took about 30-45 minutes to make everything, and has great sources of a lot of key vitamins/nutrients. Great for a quick lunch or dinner!"
