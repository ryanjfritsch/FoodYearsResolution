recipeIntroParagraph: 'At the time of making these bars, I was in the process of moving to NYC. I had already sold my pots and pans which limited me in the foods I was able to cook. This recipe was perfect for my situation because it only required a food processor (which I still had), and a non-stick pan. Easy recipe, and a great turn out.'

<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">In a medium bowl, add the melted butter, pretzel crumbs, confectioners' sugar and 1 cup of the peanut butter and stir together until well combined.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of an ungreased 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Combine the chocolate chips and the remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter in a microwave-safe bowl.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate and peanut butter are melted and smooth; two intervals should be enough.</li>
