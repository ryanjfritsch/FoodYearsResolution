recipeIntroParagraph: "I saw a video on YouTube from Tasty (linked below) showcasing this dessert recipe, and it looked so crazy I knew I had to try it. Getting the chocolate ball to form correctly took a few tries, but worked every time after I switched from Hershey's milk chocolate to Hershey's dark chocolate. In the video, the chocolate ball is melted with hot chocolate sauce. I saw a second video from the MGM Grand kitchen showing a similar recipe that melted the ball with ignited rum, which provided all the inspiration I needed to try that as well. The fire is incredible in dimly-lit environments, and the reveal of the contents inside the chocolate ball is even better. The Kraken spiced rum tasted great with the chocolate and fruit too! This is not a recipe I will make often, but one I can bring out when I want to impress dinner guests."

    <li>1 scoop of vanilla ice cream</li>
    <li>2 brownie bites</li>
    <li>Raspberries</li>
    <li>Blueberries</li>
    <li>Strawberries</li>
    <li>Dark spiced rum (Kraken was used in this recipe)</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;  margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Equipment</h1>
<ul style="font-size: 20px; margin: 0 0 50px 0;">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">6" plastic fillable ornament</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Small pot</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Lighter</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Melt 8oz of dark chocolate in a small pot by placing the small pot in a medium pot of warm water. Let the chocolate cool so it is warm to the touch but not too hot.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Pour the melted chocolate into one half of the fillable ornament. Close the ornament with the other half.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Spin the ornament in your hands, making sure the heat from the chocolate does not push the two sides of the ornament open. The chocolate should completely coat the inside of the ornament.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">For about 10 minutes, continue to rotate the ornament in all directions to make sure the chocolate is evenly distributed around the inside of the ornament.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Place the ornament in the freezer. Flip the ornament upside-down every 5 minutes. Do this 3-4 times.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Let the ornament sit in the freezer for about 5-6 hours. You will know the chocolate is separating from the ornament when the visible color turns from brown to frosty white. This happens when the chocolate is no longer touching the plastic.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Stack two brownies or brownie bites in the center of a large plate or pan. Place one scoop of ice cream ontop of the brownies.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Place raspberries on the plate in a cirlcle around the bottom of the brownie bites. Carefully place blueberries on the tops of the raspberries.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Remove the chocolate ball from the plastic ornament.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Using the bottom of a heated pan, spin the chocolate ball on the hot surface to melt part of the chocolate and create an opening big enough to fit around the fruit and sweets on the plate. Place the chocolate ball on the plate.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Place as many strawberries as you would like around the chocolate ball.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Warm a decent amount of spiced rum on the stove in a small pot (use your judgement on the amount of rum). Make sure the rum does not get close to boiling; we are warming it to make it easier to ignite and stay ignited.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Using a long lighter, ignite the rum inside the pot.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Pour the rum on top of the chocolate ball, being careful about any spills. The rum shouldn't splash, but the flames are extremely hot, so be mindful.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">The ball should melt within 10-15 seconds and will reveal the contents. Enjoy!</li>
