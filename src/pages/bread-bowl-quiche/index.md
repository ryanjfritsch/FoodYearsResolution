recipeIntroParagraph: "Nothing too special about this recipe. I hadn't seen a quiche made in a bread bowl before though, so I gave it a try. It was great! The swiss cheese at the bottom of the bowl was a game changer. It was smart to use the melted cheese as a 'water-tight seal' (as the recipe said) to prevent the liquid cream ingredients from soaking into the bread, which would have made it soggy. This was another heavy recipe which is not surprising considering the amount of bread and cheese used. But like most of the other heavy recipes I've made, it was very good! Now that I'm thinking about it I haven't mixed in a healthy recipe in a while... it might be time to do that soon."

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Ingredients</h1>

<h3>Panera Bread</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>One 9-inch or two 5-inch round sourdough bowls</li>
</ul>

<h3>Safeway</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>12 ounces French raclette or other soft Swiss cheese, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 ounces thick-cut smoked bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>1 large shallot, chopped</li>
    <li>2 ounces Gruyere, finely grated</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups half-and-half</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Using a paring knife, cut a circle on the top of the bread about 3/4 inch from the side and about 1/2 inch from the bottom.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Remove the top and scoop out the insides, leaving a 1/2-inch wall around the sides and bottom. Reserve the top and bread scraps for another use.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Brush the outside crust (sides and bottom) of the loaf with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Completely cover the inside bottom and sides of the bread bowl with the sliced raclette. Cover the outside crust with foil to protect it from browning, leaving the hole and the cheese exposed.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the cheese is fully melted but not browned, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Meanwhile, cook the bacon and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium heat until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the thyme and shallots to the skillet and cook until the shallots are tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the bacon.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">When the cheese is melted, remove the bread bowl from the oven and, using a small spoon, scoop the melted cheese from the bottom of the bowl and spread it up onto the sides of the bowl, gently pressing it into the crumb to create a watertight seal around the entire inside surface of the bowl.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Sprinkle the Gruyere over the bottom of the bowl and top with the bacon and shallots.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Blend the half-and-half, salt, cayenne, nutmeg and eggs in a blender on low speed until completely smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Strain through a fine-mesh sieve (to remove the foam) and then pour into the bread bowl, filling it to just below the top of the bowl.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Lower the oven temperature to 325°F. Bake until the edges of the quiche are set but the center still wobbles slightly, 55 to 75 minutes (it will continue to set after baking).</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in a warm place (stovetop is best) to prevent cracks forming on the top, at least 3 hours, before slicing.</li>
</ol>
