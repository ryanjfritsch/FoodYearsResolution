recipeIntroParagraph: "My mom has made this pie many times before, but I've never made it myself. It's a homerun every time and I will definitely keep it in mind whenever I need to make a pie for any event. It's really easy to make, especially if you just buy a frozen pie crust and don't make one on your own. It also goes great with ice cream, whipped cream, or a glass of milk."
