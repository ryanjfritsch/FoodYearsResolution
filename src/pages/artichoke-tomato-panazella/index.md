recipeIntroParagraph: "Giada de Laurentiis has some great recipes on FoodNetwork.com, and this was another of her's. It looked intriguing and I hadn't made anything with artichoke before, so I decided to give it a shot. It turned out okay. Not the best thing I've made, but very heathly. There's always a correlation between how good something tastes and how unhealthy it is. I didn't realize until after I was done making the meal that the bread cubes are supposed to be the crutons of the salad. I wasn't able to get them as crunchy as I would have wanted, and will leave them on the grill or use the broiler next time."

    <li>1 cup pitted black olives, halved</li>
