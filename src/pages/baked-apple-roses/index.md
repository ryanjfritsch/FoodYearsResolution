recipeIntroParagraph: "I just wanted to try these roses because they looked really cool and have that 'wow' factor. They turned out visually just as expected! Unfortunately, the taste wasn't as good as I was hoping for. I was imagining they would have more apple flavor but these didn't. I think I could have used a different type of apple to provide the flavor I was looking for. I used fuji apples, and I will have to search online for the best apples for baking if I try this again. Overall not bad, but just a slight disappointment."

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Ingredients</h1>

<h3>Morton William's</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>1 large red apple, very thinly sliced (preferrably granny smith, not fuji)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon confectioner's sugar</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat oven to 400Â°F.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Butter 2 small ramekins (6 to 8 ounce) and dust with white sugar.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Place apple slices on a plate, overlapping slightly if necessary. Microwave on High about 45 seconds just until slices have softened a bit. Cover plate with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Roll puff pastry sheet to less than 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, cut two 3-inch by 12-inch rectangles. Reserve remaining pieces for another use.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Spread melted butter over dough; top with a generous amount of cinnamon-sugar. Place apple slices along 1 long edge of dough, about 1/4 inch beyond edge of dough, overlapping slices slightly.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Fold bottom half of dough over the apple slices to form a long "folder" of dough with rounded edges of apple slices exposed.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Beat egg and water together in a bowl. Paint surface of dough with egg wash. Sprinkle with more cinnamon-sugar, to taste.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Starting from one end, roll dough not too tightly to form a rose-shaped pastry. Seal roll with end of dough strip.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Transfer roses to prepared ramekins. Sprinkle with a little more cinnamon-sugar. Place ramekins directly on middle rack of preheated oven.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bake until well browned, about 45 minutes. Remove ramekins with tongs and place on baking sheet to cool 5 to 10 minutes. Remove apple roses from ramekins and finish cooling on rack.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>
</ol>
