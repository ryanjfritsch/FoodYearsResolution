recipeIntroParagraph: "These buffalo chicken taco shells with mac and cheese and bacon filling were as absurd as they look. The combination of the buffalo sauce with the cheese from the mac and cheese was fantastic, and the small bits of bacon made it even better. I didn't have a recipe for this meal, I just saw a picture on First We Feast's Instagram page, and wanted to give it a shot. I didn't know if the chicken would actually solidify into the taco shell shape or not, but to my surprise they did. As you would imagine, these tacos are very heavy, and most people will only eat one or two. Nevertheless, this was a unique meal that I enjoyed creating."
