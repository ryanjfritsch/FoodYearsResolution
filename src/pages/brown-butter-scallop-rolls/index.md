recipeIntroParagraph: "I've only used seafood in two of the 27 recipes I've completed so far, and I want to more often in the second half of this challenge. I have only had scallops once before (at Benihana) and liked them, and they tasted great this time around as well. This recipe wasn't hard at all but getting the scallops to turn golden brown as the recipe calls took longer than I thought. Adding the butter definitely helped speed up the process and turn them crispy. I liked the herb/spice additions as well. The potato rolls and butter lettuce helped decrease the seafood taste, for those who aren't seafood fans. I was able to make 3 rolls with this recipe rather than the specified 4, and finished everything. No leftovers this time!"

<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>1 pound sea scallops (about 16), "foot" muscles removed</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>6 sprigs thyme, leaves stripped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the rolls</li>
    <li>4 potato hot dog rolls</li>
    <li>8 leaves Boston or Bibb lettuce</li>
    <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon, plus wedges for serving</li>
    <li>J1 tablespoon chopped fresh chervil or tarragon</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cut the scallops in half (two half-circles) and transfer to a medium bowl; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the olive oil, thyme and parsley and toss to coat; cover and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Generously butter the insides of the rolls. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rolls, buttered-side down, and toast until golden, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Remove to a plate and let cool, then tuck 2 lettuce leaves into each.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Heat the skillet over medium-high heat and add the scallops in a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until golden on one side, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Flip the scallops and add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter to the pan, swirling to distribute the butter.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Tilt the pan slightly and spoon the butter over the scallops until they are cooked through and the butter begins to brown and smell nutty, about 3 more minutes. Add the lemon juice and toss.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Divide the scallops among the rolls and drizzle with the browned butter. Sprinkle with the chopped herbs and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
