recipeIntroParagraph: "Unfortunately, this recipe was a flop. I was expecting the gnocchi to turn out fluffy and light, but they came out solid and rubbery. I am not sure if this was caused by the sweet potatoes, or the use of too much flour to turn the potatoes into dough, but the texture was not apetizing. The sauce that topped the gnocchi was good, but it was made from butter, cinnamon, and maple syrup; what's not to like in that? Next time I would try the recipe with normal potatoes, and try to use less flour to make sure the gnocchi came out less rubbery."

<h3>Morton William's</h3>

<h4>Gnocchi</h4>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>2 pounds sweet potatoes</li>
    <li>2/3 cup whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 & 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus 1/3 cup for the work surface</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sauce</h4>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick)</li>
    <li>20 fresh sage leaves</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Pierce the sweet potato with a fork. Bake the sweet potatoes until tender and fully cooked, between 40 to 55 minutes depending on size.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cool slightly. Cut in half and scoop the flesh into a large bowl. Mash the sweet potatoes and transfer to a large measuring cup to make sure the sweet potatoes measure about 2 cups.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Transfer the mashed sweet potatoes back to the large bowl. Add the ricotta cheese, salt, cinnamon, and pepper and blend until well mixed.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time until a soft dough forms.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Lightly flour a work surface and place the dough in a ball on the work surface.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Divide the dough into 6 equal balls. Roll out each ball into a 1-inch wide rope. Cut each rope into 1-inch pieces.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Roll the gnocchi over the tines of a fork. Transfer the formed gnocchi to a large baking sheet. Continue with the remaining gnocchi.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the gnocchi in 3 batches and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Drain the gnocchi using a slotted spoon onto a baking sheet. Tent with foil to keep warm and continue with the remaining gnocchi.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">For the Brown Butter sauce: While the gnocchi are cooking melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">When the butter has melted add the sage leaves. Continue to cook, swirling the butter occasionally, until the foam subsides and the milk solids begin to brown.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the cinnamon, maple syrup, salt, and pepper. Careful, the mixture will bubble up. Gently stir the mixture.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">When the bubbles subside, toss the cooked gnocchi in the brown butter.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Transfer the gnocchi to a serving dish and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
