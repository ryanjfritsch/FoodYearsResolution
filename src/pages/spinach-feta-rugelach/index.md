<h3>Morton William's</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>10 ounces frozen chopped spinach</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>3/4 cup crumbled feta</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>One 14.1-ounce box refrigerated rolled pie crusts (2 crusts total)</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten with a splash of water</li>
    <li>Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Set the frozen spinach out on a plate at room temperature to soften slightly.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the garlic and a few turns of black pepper and cook until fragrant, 1 more minute.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the flour and stir to combine, then stir in the spinach and a good pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the spinach is heated through and the mixture is combined.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Stir in the feta, heavy cream, lemon juice and hot sauce, then remove it from the heat. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Roll out half of the pie dough on a lightly floured surface until it is a large round, about 1/4 inch thick. (If using store-bought pre-rolled dough, simply unroll it onto your surface.)</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Spread on half the spinach mixture in an even layer so that it covers the dough.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut the dough like a pizza into 8 triangular wedges. Roll up each section starting at the wide end.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Transfer the rugelach to the lined baking sheets, placing them 1 inch apart. Repeat with the other half of the dough and spinach filling.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Lightly brush the tops with egg wash and sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly and enjoy. Store leftovers in the fridge and reheat in a toaster oven.</li>
</ol>
