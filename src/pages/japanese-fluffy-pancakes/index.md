recipeIntroParagraph: "Remember Tasty videos? Back in 2016 Tasty was all over Facebook and Instagram with their short and seemingly easy to make recipes. People loved watching and sharing the videos, but I'm not sure how many people actually made the food the video displayed. I happened to see a video of Japanese fluffy pancakes on Instagram from a different source, and researched how to make them. Tasty has an easy to follow recipe video on YouTube, so I decided to use it. The fluffy pancakes came out great! I doubled the ingredients of the recipe which produced about 12-15 pancakes. I didn't want to go out and buy the small ring molds the video shows, so I cut four 2-3 inch high rings from two large soda cans. I used AriZona iced tea cans because the diameter of the can is larger than most sodas. This worked out great, but I learned that the pancake batter sticks to the inside of the rings, so spraying the inside of the can with Pam before pouring the batter in is necessary. Also, the whipped egg whites deflated in the pancake batter after some time, which caused the last batches of pancakes to be less fluffy. Because I doubled up the recipe, I would suggest making half the amount of pancake batter first, then making the second batch when ready. Additionally, I would use a little less sugar than the recipe calls for. The pancakes tasted great and were really sweet, but lowering the amount of sugar used would make them a little bit healthier."
