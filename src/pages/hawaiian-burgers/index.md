recipeIntroParagraph: "Summer is almost here, and its time to start firing up the grill again. These Hawaiian burgers were awesome, but there were a few small changes I would make next time. I made the patties a little bit too thick and round, which made stacking the cheese, bacon and pineapple on top somewhat difficult. I also probably would have added more of the teriyaki/mayo combination sauce as I wasn't able to taste it very much. That being said, I can definitely see myself making these burgers again later in the summer."

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Ingredients</h1>

<h3>Safeway</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1/2 cup teriyaki cooking sauce or marinade</li>
    <li>1 small pineapple, peeled and cored</li>
    <li>24 ounces lean ground beef</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>8 slices bacon</li>
    <li>4 onion rolls, split</li>
    <li>4 slices mozzarella</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Mix the mayonnaise and 1/4 cup of the teriyaki cooking sauce in a small bowl until combined.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Slice four 1/4-inch-thick rounds from the pineapple (reserve the remaining pineapple for another use).</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Form the beef into 4 patties and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat, alternatively prepare an outdoor grill for medium-high direct and indirect heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the bacon and pineapple in a single layer in a grill pan; if using an outdoor grill place the pineapple over direct heat and the bacon over indirect heat and cover.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cook until golden on one side, about 5 minutes for the pineapple and 7 minutes for the bacon.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Flip both with tongs and continue cooking until the bacon is crisp and the pineapple is golden and soft, about 6 minutes more for each.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Transfer to a baking sheet along with the rolls and keep warm in the oven.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the burgers to the grill pan or outdoor grill over direct heat and cook until well browned on one side, about 4 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Flip the burgers and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Brush the burgers with half the remaining teriyaki cooking sauce, top with the mozzarella and brush with more sauce.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cover the burgers with a heatproof metal bowl or grill lid and cook until the cheese is melted and the burger is cooked to desired doneness, 1 to 2 minutes for medium.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Put a burger on the bottom half of each roll and top with 2 slices bacon and 1 pineapple round.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Divide the teriyaki mayonnaise among the burgers, spooning it into the hole of each pineapple round. Top with the roll tops.</li>
