recipeIntroParagraph: "This time, I decided to switch it up and try a breakfast recipe: some simple crepes with fruit and chocolate. I followed the crepe recipe from the All Recipes link posted below, and then added the fruit as shown in the picture. I also thought some mini chocolate chips under the fruit and melted chocolate on top of the crepe would make them taste even better. This receipe was fairly easy to setup, and didn't take too long to complete. The toughest part was making sure the crepe didn't burn on the skillet. Nutella, cinnamon, and/or powdered sugar can be added as well."

<h3>Safeway</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>3 bananas, sliced into small circular pieces</li>
    <li>Small case of strawberries, sliced</li>
    <li>Small case of blueberries</li>
    <li>Small bag of mini-chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. </li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Place mini-chocolate chips in a line on cooked-side of crepe. The heat will melt them slightly.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">After 2-3 minutes, pull the crepe off the frying pan, and place your choice of fruit on top of chocolate chips.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Fold both sides of the crepe over the line of fruit. The crepe should hold its folded shape after 30 seconds or so.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Place fruit on top of crepe, and pour on chocolate sauce (created from melted chocolate chips and milk).</li>
