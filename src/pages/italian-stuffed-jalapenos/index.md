recipeIntroParagraph: "This was the first recipe I've made from Guy Fieri, and it didn't dissappoint! It was truly a trip to flavortown. The spice levels were perfect; you could taste them a little bit but were not strong. The italian sausage was a great addition as well. It gave the jalapeños extra weight and some bonus flavor. I would recommend these as a party appetizer."

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Ingredients</h1>

<h3>Safeway</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>15 jalapenos, preferably red, cut in 1/2, seeded and deveined</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>2 pounds mild Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup minced red onion</li>
    <li>1/4 cup minced red bell pepper</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 cups mascarpone or cream cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add the chicken to a large stockpot, cover with water and add a large pinch of salt.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside to cool.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">When cool enough to handle, shred the chicken and set aside.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Reserve 3 1/3 cups of the broth (1 cup is for the chicken gravy, supplement with boxed stock if you don't have enough.)</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 13- by 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">In a large saucepan, combine 2 1/3 cups of the reserved broth, the Chicken Gravy, green chiles, onions, garlic, sour cream, cumin, salt and pepper.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Spread 1 cup of the mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Arrange a layer of 6 tortillas over the mixture, and then top with 1 cup shredded chicken and 1/2 cup of the Cheddar.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Repeat this layer three more times, ending with cheese. Spread any remaining mixture over the cheese.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Make sure all of the tortillas are covered or they will get very hard during baking.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bake uncovered for 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Chicken Gravy</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Melt the butter in a medium saucepan and whisk in the flour to make a roux.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and the flour turns light brown in color.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Gradually whisk in the stock and milk and continue to stir while cooking over medium heat.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">When the mixture thickens, after about 5 minutes, whisk in some salt and pepper.</li>
</ol>
