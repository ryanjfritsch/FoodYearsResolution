recipeIntroParagraph: 'These were great as a Super Bowl apetizer. They were really easy to make and using spicy mustard took them to the next level. Next time I should wrap the dough tighter so that the cheese stays inside in the oven. I think a lot of the cheese was lost during baking.'

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B;">Ingredients</h1>

<h3>Whole Foods</h3>
<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
    <li>Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking sheet</li>
    <li>One 13.8-ounce tube refrigerated pizza dough, such as Pillsbury</li>
    <li>6 ounces processed cheese, such as Velveeta, cut into twenty-four 1/2-inch squares</li>
    <li>2/3 cup baking soda</li>
    <li>Pretzel salt, or other coarse salt, for topping</li>
    <li>Spicy mustard, for dipping</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Position an oven rack to the top third position and preheat to 450Â°F. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Press and stretch the dough into an 11-by-16-inch rectangle. Cut the rectangle into twenty-four 2 1/2-inch squares.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Put a piece of cheese in the center of a square. Pinch two opposing corners of the dough together over the cheese.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Do the same with the other two corners to create a bundle. Pinch the folded sides together to secure the cheese. Repeat with the remaining dough and cheese.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Heat 6 cups water in a medium saucepan and over high heat. Whisk in the baking soda and bring to a boil. Working in batches, boil the dumplings 30 seconds.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Transfer them to the prepared baking sheet seam-side up and quickly sprinkle with salt.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bake the dumplings, rotating halfway through, until dark brown, about 10 minutes. Serve with spicy mustard.</li>
</ol>
