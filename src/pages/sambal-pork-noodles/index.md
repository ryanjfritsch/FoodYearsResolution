recipeIntroParagraph: 'I saw the photo of these noodles on the Bon Appetit Instagram page and really wanted to give them a try. They were incredible, if you are fine with a little heat. The chili paste added a nice kick, and the sugar made the noodles sweet. This is definitely a recipe I will go back and make again in the future.'

<h1 style="color: #2B2B2B; margin-top: 40px;">Cooking Instructions</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px" className="cookingInstructionsOL">
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Heat oil in a large wide heavy pot over medium-high.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add half of pork to pot, breaking apart into 6–8 large chunks with a wooden spoon. Cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Turn pieces and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until pork is browned on 2–3 sides, about 5 minutes longer.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add ginger, garlic, sugar, and remaining pork to pot and cook, breaking up pork into small clumps, until meat is nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes longer.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add tomato paste and 2 basil sprigs. Cook, stirring occasionally, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add chili paste, soy sauce, vinegar, and 2 cups water.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors have melded, 30–45 minutes.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until 1 minute short of al dente.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Add to pot with sauce along with butter and a splash of pasta cooking liquid.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Simmer, tossing occasionally, until sauce begins to cling to noodles, about 1 minute. Pluck out basil sprigs.</li>
</ol>
