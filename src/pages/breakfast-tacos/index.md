recipeIntroParagraph: "What's not to like in this recipe? It was a pretty simple combination of breakfast favorites: pancakes, bacon and scrambled eggs. I used the pancakes as taco shells, put the eggs and bacon in the middle, and then put some syrup on top. A bite of all three foods with the syrup tasted amazing. Though optional, I used a metal taco rack to prop the tacos up and let the pancakes form into their shell shape. The most interesting part of this recipe is really the presentation; the ingredients aren't complicated at all but the final result is pretty unique."

    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Cook the 5 strips of bacon in a skillet. Cook to desired crispness.</li>
    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Chop bacon into small bits/chunks. Place in a bowl and set to the side.</li>

    <li style="margin: 5px 0;">Make 3 to 5 6-inch pancakes. You will want to make them big enough to hold a decent amount of egg/bacon filling.</li>
